## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Systems
1. Run this checklist as part of automated validation
2. Use scoring to determine if output needs human review
3. Focus on high-impact items first (data accuracy, relationships)
4. Use detailed breakdown to identify specific improvement areas

### For Human Reviewers
1. Use as systematic review guide
2. Focus on business logic and domain expertise
3. Verify AI-generated embedded entity conversions
4. Validate security and compliance requirements

### For Teams
1. Establish minimum quality thresholds
2. Use in CI/CD pipelines for schema validation
3. Track quality improvements over time
4. Share as documentation quality standard

This comprehensive checklist ensures enterprise-ready database documentation that meets all critical quality criteria for production use.
